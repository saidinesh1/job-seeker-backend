**Company:** Aesthetic Designs  
**Location:** Mumbai, India  
**Job Type:** Full-time  
**Experience:** Minimum 10 years

Are you passionate about shaping urban environments and creating vibrant street experiences? Aesthetic Designs, situated in the dynamic city of Mumbai, is a pioneering company that values the fusion of creativity, functionality, and urban aesthetics. We are actively seeking a Senior Cityscape and Street Scape Designer to join our team and contribute to crafting captivating cityscapes and enhancing tourism planning initiatives.

**About Us:**

Aesthetic Designs is at the forefront of innovation in urban design, placemaking, and tourism planning. Our work transcends traditional boundaries, weaving artistry and practicality to transform urban spaces into dynamic, immersive experiences. We are committed to shaping urban landscapes that reflect our rich cultural heritage and inspire future generations.

**Role and Responsibilities:**

Sustainable architects play a crucial role in designing and developing tall buildings that are environmentally responsible and energy-efficient. Their responsibilities encompass various aspects of the building's design, construction, and operation to ensure sustainability throughout the building's lifecycle. Here are some key responsibilities of sustainable architects for tall buildings:

Sustainable Design:Incorporate sustainable design principles from the initial concept phase, considering factors such as site selection, orientation, and building shape to maximize energy efficiency and minimize environmental impact.  
Employ passive design strategies, such as natural ventilation, daylighting, and shading, to reduce energy consumption and enhance occupant comfort.

Energy Efficiency:Specify energy-efficient building systems and materials to reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions.  
Implement high-performance insulation, windows, and HVAC systems to optimize energy efficiency in a tall building's envelope.

Renewable Energy:Integrate renewable energy sources, such as solar panels or wind turbines, into the building's design to generate clean energy on-site.

Water Efficiency:Design water-efficient plumbing systems, fixtures, and landscaping to minimize water consumption.  
Explore rainwater harvesting and greywater recycling systems to reduce the demand for potable water.

Materials Selection:Choose sustainable, locally sourced, and low-impact building materials to reduce the environmental footprint of construction.  
Consider the life cycle assessment of materials to assess their long-term sustainability.

Green Certifications:Work towards achieving green building certifications like LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) or BREEAM (Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method) to validate the sustainability of the design and construction.

Site Ecology:Integrate green spaces, urban farming, or green roofs into the building design to enhance biodiversity and improve air quality.  
Consider the impact of the building on the local ecosystem and mitigate any negative effects.

Adaptability and Resilience:Design buildings with flexibility and adaptability to accommodate changing needs and technologies over time.  
Consider climate resilience strategies to ensure the building can withstand extreme weather events and changing environmental conditions.

Lifecycle Analysis:Conduct life cycle assessments to evaluate the environmental impact of the building from construction through operation and eventual demolition or repurposing.

Education and Advocacy:Educate clients, stakeholders, and the public about the benefits of sustainable design and the long-term value it brings.  
Advocate for sustainable practices and policies within the construction industry and regulatory bodies.

Collaboration:Collaborate closely with engineers, builders, and other professionals to ensure that sustainable design goals are met during construction and operation.

Sustainable architects must balance the aesthetic and functional aspects of tall building design with a commitment to minimizing environmental impact, reducing resource consumption, and enhancing the well-being of occupants. Their role is pivotal in creating sustainable urban environments and addressing the challenges of climate change and urbanization.

**Qualifications:**

* A minimum of 7-10 years of experience in Tall Building
* Preferred qualifications include a Post Graduate Degree in Urban Planning or

equivalent.

Educational background such as an MBA or Two-year Postgraduate Diploma in Planning, or a Graduate Degree in Architecture (with valid Council Of Architecture registration).

**Sourcing Model**


Recruitment at FIS works primarily on a direct sourcing model; a relatively small portion of our hiring is through recruitment agencies. FIS does not accept resumes from recruitment agencies which are not on the preferred supplier list and is not responsible for any related fees for resumes submitted to job postings, our employees, or any other part of our company.
