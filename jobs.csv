About Avalara:
**About Avalara:**  

We’re building cloud-based tax compliance solutions to handle every transaction in the world. Imagine every transaction you make — every tank of gas, cup of coffee, or pair of sneakers, every movie ticket, meal kit, or streamed song, every sensor-to-sensor ping. Nearly every time you make a purchase, physical or digital, there’s an accompanying unique and nuanced tax compliance calculation. The logic behind calculating taxes — the rules, rates, and boundaries is a global, layered, three-dimensional mess of complexity, with compliance dictated by governments and applied by every business, every day.  

Avalara works with businesses of all sizes, all over the world — from corner stores to gigantic global retailers — to calculate tax accurately and automatically, at speeds measured in milliseconds. That’s a massive technical challenge, in terms of scale, reliability, and complexity, and we do it better than anyone. That’s why we’re growing fast. Headquartered in Seattle, Avalara has offices across the U.S. and around the world, in Brazil, Canada, India, U.K, Belgium and across Europe. **Equal Opportunities:**

We are looking for a Senior Software Engineer with expertise in Full-stack technologies to join our globally distributed Electronic Invoicing & Live Reporting (ELR) team and assist us to become a global leader in the e-invoicing market, and part of every transaction in the world!We have a phenomenal team working in an open, collaborative environment that makes taxes and compliance less taxing to deal with. It will be up to you and the team to convert the product vision and requirements into a finished product. Avalara is a global, company. Despite our size, we maintain a startup culture focused on building great software and having the maximum impact on the world that we can, and having fun while doing it. Check us out. We'd love to talk to you about what we are up to!
Responsibilities:
* Avalara e-Invoicing and Platforms: Dig into our multi-patented, cloud-native Avalara product suite. We are building a flexible, extensible platform capable of handling any opportunity to create and submit electronic invoices and live reporting processes for any industry in any geography. Work with your team to create that while maximizing performance, scalability, and reliability while making it 'oh-so-simple' to operate.
* Code, Review, Commit: Become part of the team to deliver more than you ever thought possible. Research, identify, and utilize appropriate tools, libraries, frameworks, and languages to solve problems and deliver results using the most effective methods - document software functionality, including public APIs and customer-facing UIs. Participate in project estimation and scoping exercises. Perform code reviews and have your code reviewed by peers.
* Create Industry-Leading Products: Avalara is the market leader, and we intend on staying that way. That means we can't be complacent. Own key areas within our platform. And as owners, we actively encourage everyone to make bold moves and keep testing the limits. Innovation is what drives our success - help us keep pushing that needle further.
* Automation vs. People Power. Computers are great for process automation, but there's a limit to what they can do. You and the team will tackle the unique challenges at the intersection of software
* You + Avalara = Infinity: Avalara's vision is to be part of every transaction of every business around the world. That means making Avalara ELR a platform that can handle not just the submission of invoices but all the continuous compliance processes with any government in any geography. In fact, we want every government to use Avalara on their end as well! The possibilities of what Avalara can do and what you can do for it are open-ended! You are not just another engineer when you join Avalara. You and Avalara equal endless possibilities!


Qualifications:
* 3 + years Experience Required
* You have a track record of delivering valuable, high-quality features into production. If we ask you to tell us about your work that went into production, you can substantiate the claim by telling us about specific examples and how you knew it was done well.
* You know what's fundamentally different about software designed for the cloud from on-premise, not because you read about it but because you've been knee-deep in SaaS. That means you have experience with things like service-oriented architectures, microservices, and web application development. You have a firm understanding of system performance trade-offs, load balancing, and engineering for high availability.
* A full-stack developer - While many parts of our solution are implemented using .NET and Java stack, we also have details of the product in node.js, python, and other technologies. So, experience and willingness to use a broad set of technologies while claiming product expertise in .NET/.Net Core platform and C# is a real plus with us. Experience with NET, React, Angular will be desirable. We call that a T-shaped person. Experience designing and developing microservices, webservices, REST API is preferred.
* As far as other technologies, we use MySQL and PostgresDB as our primary transactional RDBMS, and we are introducing many other cloud technologies Redis, Snowflake, and Prometheus. Streaming technologies like Kafka, Kinesis, and visualization tools like Grafana are regularly in the conversation. And, of course, containerization using Docker and orchestration using Kubernetes. We are an AWS shop. A background in Azure or GCP is also welcomed.
* Collaborate with other teams to solve cross functional challenges and optimize code to improve application efficiency.
* Prior experience working in eInvoicing is preferred.
* A Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, Engineering, or related field is desirable. But really, it's not required if you can demonstrate that you have the right skills. A track record that proves that it is more important to us.

**Preferred Qualifications:*** At Avalara, we put a great deal of emphasis on collaboration and maintaining an open working environment - having great coworkers is one of the most significant determinants for enjoying your work, and we take our enjoyment of work very seriously.
* You take pride in delivering your work to production. If the business needs to be changed and that feature is no longer necessary, you want to be asking yourself, how come I didn't see it coming?
* You take quality seriously. You hate running the same test over and over. But even worse is that you take it personally when something breaks. You've seen, or better yet implemented, a CICD pipeline with automated testing.
* Avalara is a scrum shop. You've participated in daily standup and know the difference between backlog grooming and sprint planning, how to do estimation, and how not to plan. When we ask you why retrospectives are essential, you should have a great answer with a specific example that shows how you and the team improved through iterations.
* Your opinions matter. We are driven by technology and innovation, and we look to the most intelligent, most passionate people on the team as the source of ideas.


About Avalara:
**About Avalara:**  

We’re building cloud-based tax compliance solutions to handle every transaction in the world. Imagine every transaction you make — every tank of gas, cup of coffee, or pair of sneakers, every movie ticket, meal kit, or streamed song, every sensor-to-sensor ping. Nearly every time you make a purchase, physical or digital, there’s an accompanying unique and nuanced tax compliance calculation. The logic behind calculating taxes — the rules, rates, and boundaries is a global, layered, three-dimensional mess of complexity, with compliance dictated by governments and applied by every business, every day.  

Avalara works with businesses of all sizes, all over the world — from corner stores to gigantic global retailers — to calculate tax accurately and automatically, at speeds measured in milliseconds. That’s a massive technical challenge, in terms of scale, reliability, and complexity, and we do it better than anyone. That’s why we’re growing fast. Headquartered in Seattle, Avalara has offices across the U.S. and around the world, in Brazil, Canada, India, U.K, Belgium and across Europe. **Equal Opportunities:**

 We have a unique culture that we are proud of. We think of ourselves primarily as problem-solvers, which itself is a two-part idea. We come up with the solution, but the solution isn't real until it is built and delivered to the customer. That penchant for action gives us a pragmatic approach to innovation, one that has served us well since 2002.

 CRED is an exclusive community for India’s most trustworthy and creditworthy individuals, where the members are rewarded for good financial behavior. CRED was born out of a need to bring back the focus on a long lost virtue, one of trust, the idea being to create a community centered around this virtue. a community that constantly strives to become more virtuous in this regard till they finally scale their behavior to create a utopia where being trustworthy is the norm and not the exception. to build a community like this requires a community of its own; a community special in its own way, working towards making this vision come true.
 



  





 here’s a thought experiment: what do you get when you put a group of incredibly passionate and driven people and entrust them with the complete freedom to chase down their goals in a completely uninhibited manner? answer: you get something close to what we have at CRED; CRED just has it better.
 



  





 here’s what will be in store for you at CRED once you join as a part of the customer success team
 



  





**what will you do:** 



* you will work on a disruptive product that’s still in its early stages
* you will be responsible to drive innovation in software development, while relentlessly improving performance, scalability, and maintainability.
* you will own the design process, implementation, and verification of framework components leveraging standard software engineering methodologies
* you will be translating functional and technical requirements into detailed architecture and design.
* you will be responsible for mentoring other engineers, defining our technical culture, and helping to build a fast-growing team.



  





**you should apply if you:** 



* someone having 6-8 years of experience in product development, architecture, and design

* mentoring and supporting other team members by doing code reviews and applying your experience in process and technical leadership
* working in an agile team environment and are a self-starter, conscientious member of the team
* passionate to code, but also you’re awesome at it!
* interested in working with Java/Golang programming languages, have proficiency in DDB, RDS, Aerospike databases, and possess experience with the AWS cloud platform



  





**how is life at CRED?** 




 working at CRED would instantly make you realize one thing: you are working with the best talent around you. not just in the role you occupy, but everywhere you go. talk to someone around you; most likely you will be talking to a singer, standup comic, artist, writer, an athlete, maybe a magician. at CRED people always have talent up their sleeves. with the right company, even conversations can be rejuvenating. at CRED, we guarantee a good company.
 



  





 hard truths: pushing oneself comes with the role. and we realise pushing oneself is hard work. which is why CRED is in the continuous process of building an environment that helps the team rejuvenate oneself: included but not limited to a stacked, in-house pantry, with lunch and dinner provided for all the team members, paid sick leaves and a comprehensive health insurance.
 



  





 to make things smoother and to make sure you spend time and energy only on the most important things, CRED strives to make every process transparent: there are no work timings because we do not believe in archaic methods of calculating productivity, your work should speak for you. there are no job designations because you will be expected to hold down roles that cannot be described in one word.
